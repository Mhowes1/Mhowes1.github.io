I styled the chart with geom_col(fill = “red”), added axis labels, and used coord_flip() to make the teams readable along the vertical axis. I repeated the same process for the 2024 dataset (avg_plays_24), this time filling the bars blue to distinguish the seasons.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(avg_plays_24, aes(x = reorder(Team, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"blue\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"More plays don't equate to success, as seen by the 4-8 Terps\", \n    x = \"Team\", \n    y = \"Average Plays in 2024\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(avg_plays_25, aes(x = reorder(Team, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"red\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Maryland averages the fifth-most offensive plays with a freshman QB\", \n    x = \"Team\", \n    y = \"Average Plays in 2025\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025 chart shows Maryland averaging the fifth-most offensive plays, suggesting tempo has remained a key part of its strategy under a new quarterback. In contrast, the 2024 chart highlights that more offensive plays didn’t always translate to wins, as Maryland still finished 4–8 despite ranking high in tempo. Across the two years, the overall distribution indicates Big Ten teams are running slightly fewer plays on average in 2025 compared to 2024. A notable shift is that Rutgers and Indiana moved upward in the rankings this season, while teams like Purdue and Iowa have fallen further behind.\nThe biggest takeaway is that pace alone doesn’t guarantee success — it must be paired with efficiency and execution."

That contrast suggests Maryland maintains a more balanced approach on 3rd-and-medium situations, while other programs tend to lean heavily on the passing game."

That stability means even small movements above or below averages can signal meaningful change. For Maryland, which often sits right around those benchmarks, breaking into the upper-right quadrant of the grid — meaning teams with both efficient offenses and stingy defenses — remains a challenge.\n\n\nCode\nall_teams &lt;- ypp\numd &lt;- ypp |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Maryland\") |&gt;\n  mutate(incomplete = Season == 2025)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nypp |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    offense = mean(OffensiveYPP), \n    defense = mean(DefensiveYPP)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  offense defense\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    5.76    5.63\n\n\nAcross every FBS team from 2015 to 2025, the average offense produced about 5.76 yards per play, while the average defense allowed 5.63 yards per play.\nThose numbers form the baseline for the grid lines in the visualization that follows. Teams above the horizontal line gave up fewer yards per play than average, while teams to the right of the vertical line moved the ball more efficiently.\nFor Maryland, that means seasons landing near the center of the chart represent years of average play on both sides of the ball — a decade defined more by balance than by breakthrough.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = all_teams, \n    aes(OffensiveYPP, DefensiveYPP, size = Wins), \n    color = \"grey\", alpha = 0.5\n  ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data = umd |&gt; filter(Season != 2025),\n    aes(OffensiveYPP, DefensiveYPP, size = Wins),\n    color = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = umd |&gt; filter(Season == 2025),\n    aes(OffensiveYPP, DefensiveYPP, size = Wins),\n    shape = 21, fill = NA, color = \"red\", stroke = 1.2\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.762959) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.627613) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = umd, \n    aes(OffensiveYPP, DefensiveYPP, label = Season), size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Terps’ offense and defense show mixed results across the past decade.\",\n    subtitle = \"The Terps rarely break into the upper tier of efficiency on either side of the ball.\",\n    caption = \"Source: NCAA\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaryland’s placement on the YPP grid shows a decade defined by balance but inconsistency.\nMost of the Terps’ red dots cluster near the center, meaning their offensive and defensive efficiency has hovered around the national average since 2015. A few seasons, such as in 2021 and 2019, stand out slightly because of stronger offensive output. Others, like the 2022 and 2023 seasons, are lower as defensive lapses cancel out modest offensive gains.\nAcross the 10-year span, Maryland never breaks into the lower-right or upper-left quadrants, which would represent dominance on one side of the ball for the Terps.\nInstead, the program consistently lands in the middle — competitive but not elite, which aligns with the narratives around most of Coach Michael Locksley’s seasons. The incomplete 2025 season, shown as an open circle, continues the trend so far, with early numbers again mirroring the national baseline.\nIn fact, both defensive and offense metrics have progessed slightly less.\nSo should two wins over mediocre average opponents this season be considered a success?"

Detroit and Denver have climbed right behind them, converting drives at an elite clip, while the Giants and Houston continue to stall out when it matters most.
