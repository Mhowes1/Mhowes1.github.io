I styled the chart with geom_col(fill = “red”), added axis labels, and used coord_flip() to make the teams readable along the vertical axis. I repeated the same process for the 2024 dataset (avg_plays_24), this time filling the bars blue to distinguish the seasons.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(avg_plays_24, aes(x = reorder(Team, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"blue\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"More plays don't equate to success, as seen by the 4-8 Terps\", \n    x = \"Team\", \n    y = \"Average Plays in 2024\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(avg_plays_25, aes(x = reorder(Team, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"red\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Maryland averages the fifth-most offensive plays with a freshman QB\", \n    x = \"Team\", \n    y = \"Average Plays in 2025\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025 chart shows Maryland averaging the fifth-most offensive plays, suggesting tempo has remained a key part of its strategy under a new quarterback. In contrast, the 2024 chart highlights that more offensive plays didn’t always translate to wins, as Maryland still finished 4–8 despite ranking high in tempo. Across the two years, the overall distribution indicates Big Ten teams are running slightly fewer plays on average in 2025 compared to 2024. A notable shift is that Rutgers and Indiana moved upward in the rankings this season, while teams like Purdue and Iowa have fallen further behind.\nThe biggest takeaway is that pace alone doesn’t guarantee success — it must be paired with efficiency and execution."
