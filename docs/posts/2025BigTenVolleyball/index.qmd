I first had to load the tidyverse and waffle libraries so R could read the data, summarize it and create the waffle charts.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(waffle)
```


```{r}
match_data <- read_csv("ncaa_womens_volleyball_matchstats_2025.csv")
```
I next loaded the volleyball match data, filtered it for Maryland, calculated the team’s total stats and stored those totals in a simple named vector called md.

```{r}
maryland_data <- match_data |>
  filter(team == "Maryland")
```


```{r}
md <- maryland_data|>
  summarise(
    total_kills = sum(kills),
    total_blocks = sum(block_solos + (block_assists / 2)),
    total_aces = sum(aces),
    opponent_errors = sum(defensive_errors)
  )

md
```
```{r}
md <- c(
  Kills = 574,
  Blocks = 135.5,
  Aces = 73,
  OpponentErrors = 298
)
```
```{r}
md
```

I created a waffle chart showing Maryland’s point breakdown, scaling the totals for display and using different colors for each category.

```{r}
waffle(md / 25,
       rows = 10,
       title = "Maryland's points",
       xlab = "1 square = 1 point",
       colors = c("red", "black", "yellow", "grey"))
```

I filtered the data for Wisconsin, calculated its total stats and saved those values in a named vector called wi.

```{r}
wisconsin_data <- match_data |>
  filter(team == "Wisconsin")
```

```{r}
wi_totals <- wisconsin_data |>
  summarise(
    total_kills = sum(kills),
    total_blocks = sum(block_solos + (block_assists / 2)),
    total_aces = sum(aces),
    opponent_errors = sum(defensive_errors)
  )
```

```{r}
wi_totals
```
```{r}
wi <- c(
  Kills = 756,
  Blocks = 147,
  Aces = 75,
  OpponentErrors = 291
)
```

I combined Maryland’s and Wisconsin’s waffle charts side by side to compare their point distributions.

```{r}
iron(
  waffle(md / 25,
         rows = 10,
         title = "Maryland's points",
         xlab = "1 square = 1 point",
         colors = c("red", "black", "yellow", "grey")),
  waffle(wi / 25,
         rows = 10,
         title = "Wisconsin's points",
         xlab = "1 square = 1 point",
         colors = c("red", "black", "gray", "darkred"))
)
```

Maryland’s point distribution shows a more balanced mix across categories, with kills making up the largest share but a notable contribution from opponent errors as well. Wisconsin relies more heavily on kills and blocks, indicating a stronger offensive presence at the net. Maryland earns a greater portion of its points from serving and opponent mistakes, while Wisconsin’s totals suggest it creates more of its own scoring opportunities through attack efficiency and front-row play.
